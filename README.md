# URI / beecrowd Practice – Python Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to programming exercises from **URI Online Judge**  
(currently known as **beecrowd**).  

The main goal is to have a clean, organized place to practice algorithms, input/output, and basic
programming logic using **Python 3**.

> ⚠️ The original problem statements are **not** included here.  
> They belong to the official beecrowd platform.  
> This repo contains only my own study solutions.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Current structure:

```text
.
├── Iniciante/        # Beginner problems (Categoria "Iniciante" do URI/beecrowd)
│   ├── 1001.py
│   ├── 1002.py
│   ├── 1003.py

````

* `Iniciante/` groups the **Beginner** problems.
* Each file is named with the **problem ID** from URI/beecrowd:

  * `1001.py` → problem 1001 – *Extremely Basic*
  * `1002.py` → problem 1002 – *Area of a Circle*
  * and so on.

In the future, more folders can be added, for example:

```text
AdHoc/
Strings/
Estruturas/
Matematica/
SQL/
```

## 🎯 Objectives

* Practice Python by solving many small, focused problems.
* Build a personal archive of solved exercises.
* Serve as a reference for:

  * beginners learning to program,
  * students preparing for contests or exams,
  * anyone who wants to review basic algorithms and logic.

The idea is **learning by doing**, not copy-pasting solutions blindly.

## ▶️ How to Run the Solutions

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
```

3. Enter the folder for the problems (for now, only `Iniciante/`):

```bash
cd Iniciante
```

4. Run the solution for the problem you want.
   Example: problem **1001**:

```bash
python 1001.py
```

5. Provide the input **exactly** as described in the official problem statement on beecrowd
   and compare the output of the script with the expected output.

## 🧩 Conventions & Style

* **One problem per file**.
* File name is always the **numeric problem code**: `####.py`.
* Solutions try to be:

  * simple and readable;
  * close to the problem statement;
  * commented when the logic is less obvious or when edge cases matter.

Whenever possible, solutions use only the standard library to stay close to what online judges expect.

## 🤝 Contributions / How to Use This Repo

This is mainly a **personal study** repository, but you are welcome to:

* Use the code as **reference** to understand how a problem can be solved.
* Compare your own approach with these solutions.
* Fork the repository and experiment with refactors, different algorithms or other languages.

If you open Pull Requests, please:

1. Keep the same folder structure (`Iniciante/`, etc.).
2. Use the problem number as the filename.
3. Add comments if your approach is not straightforward at first glance.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

* All problem descriptions and test data belong to **URI / beecrowd**.
* This repository is **not** an official resource and is not affiliated with beecrowd.
* Use these solutions to **learn and practice**.
  Do not submit code you don’t understand as your own in online judges, courses, or exams.
